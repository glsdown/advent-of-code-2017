# Advent of Code 2017

These are solutions originally written in 2017 for the [Advent of Code]() challenge. It was one of my first introductions to solving problems like this, so many of the solutions are messy or poorly structured (and there are very few comments).

A better structure for how to run this challenge can be found in my [2021 AOC repository](https://github.com/glsdown/adventofcode-2021). The solutions are still not polished in here, but the structure and helper functions are better designed.

Rather than go back and make these look neat and polished, I like to be able to reflect on where I started, and the improvements that I have made over the years.
